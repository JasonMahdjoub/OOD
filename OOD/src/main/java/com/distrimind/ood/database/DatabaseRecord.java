/**
 * The database record class is a generic abstract class destinated to represent
 * a database record with each of its fields. The user must inherit this class
 * to declare a type of record. He must declare it into the correspondent
 * table/class as a public class. Moreover, he must name the child class
 * 'Record'. Every field which must be included into the database must have an
 * annotation ({@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.Field},
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.PrimaryKey},
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.AutoPrimaryKey},
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.RandomPrimaryKey},
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.NotNull},
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.Unique},
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.ForeignKey}). If no annotation
 * is given, the corresponding field will not be added into the database.
 * 
 * Note that the native types are always NotNull. Fields which have the
 * annotation {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.AutoPrimaryKey}
 * must be 'int' or 'short' values. Fields which have the annotation
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.RandomPrimaryKey} must be
 * 'long' values. Fields which have the annotation
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.annotations.ForeignKey} must be
 * DatabaseRecord instances.
 *
 * Never alter a field directly throw a function of the child class. Do it with
 * the function
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.Table#updateRecord(DatabaseRecord, java.util.Map)}.
 * Moreover, the constructor of the child class must be protected with no
 * parameter (if this constraint is not respected, an exception will be
 * generated). So it is not possible to instantiate directly this class. To do
 * that, you must use the function
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.Table#addRecord(java.util.Map)}, or the
 * function
 * {@link com.distrimind.ood.database.Table#addRecords(java.util.Map...)}.
 * 
 * The inner database fields do not need to be initialized. However, fields
 * which have no annotation (which are not included into the database) are not
 * concerned.
